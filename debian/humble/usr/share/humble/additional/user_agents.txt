# To use a specific User-Agent, use the "-ua" parameter followed by the number
# associated with the desired User-Agent in the call to "humble". For example,
# the "-ua 1" parameter will look for the first User-Agent in this file, using
# it in the request (excluding the "1.- " part of that line).
#
# Use this file to add as many User-Agents as you wish, one per line, always
# following the format below.
#
# Advice: if the User-Agent is not representative of a typical device (e.g.
# containing operating system, browser, engine, versions, etc.) it is very
# likely that the target server will process the request as coming from a
# crawler, bot or scanner, and may block or return HTTP headers that do not
# correspond to reality.
#
# Below are real User-Agents (associated with real browsers). In case
# the "-ua" parameter is not specified, the first User-Agent will be selected
# by default in the request.
